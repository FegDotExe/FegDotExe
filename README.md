### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Who I am
I'm a 19yo Italian student, currently studying information engigneering at the university of Padua (Padova, here in Italy).

I program random things which come to my mind and which I find to be either useful or entertaining to program: this can span from a quiz utility for jupyter notebook so that I can revise calculus to a pseudo game engine built on top of pygame.

# What do I know
This far, my favourite language is without a doubt python. Yes it might be super easy and slow et cetera et cetera, but I like it nonetheless.

It's also true that I've learned:
- C#
- Java
- A bit of SQL
- LaTeX (dunno if this counts but yeah, I know it)

At the same time, I'm slowly but surely learning:
- Javascript
- Html
- Css
- Go
- C

And, if you were wondering, I'm self-taught on all of these except for java, which I am still learning at the University
